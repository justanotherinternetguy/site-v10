          <h6>10/31/2024</h6>
          <p>
            As a celebratory first blog post, I am happy to say I have finally
            gotten a reliable and modern laptop computer! It is a
            <strong>Thinkpad P14s Gen 5 14" AMD</strong>. The specs are as
            follows:

            This is my first time using a 120hz refresh rate monitor and it is
            quite an experience! I never felt a need to go higher than 60hz, but
            after using 120hz I don't think I can ever go back. The laptop runs
            cool and power management is great with <code>tlp</code>. I was
            afraid I had to install some extra drivers and wrangle with
            incompatible hardware (as per my experience on my NVIDIA-based
            desktop), but I every worked fine OOTB.

            In terms of performance, it obviously has no trouble doing
            day-to-day tasks such as web browsing, word processing, and playing
            video. Programming and general software development is fine as well,
            just don't expect to be running any large deep learning models. I
            don't play video games, so I can't really speak to its gaming
            performance.
