          <h1>Thinkpad P14s Gen 5 AMD Review</h1>
          <h6>11/17/2024</h6>
          <p>
            After using my
            <a href="10-31-2024-thinkpad.html">new Thinkpad</a> for a few weeks,
            I feel I am ready to provide an in-depth, hands-on review of the
            laptop.
          </p>
          <h2 class="blogwrapper">Keyboard</h2>
          <p>
            The typing experience is really great for a laptop! The keys have a
            satisfying click and requires a reasonable amount of force to
            actuate. The keys aren't mushy or sqiushy, and will still actuate if
            pressed on the corners of the keycap. Surpasses any other laptop
            keyboard I've tried, including Macbooks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blogwrapper">Trackpad</h2>
          <p>
            Also a really great experience. Tracking is smooth and responsive,
            there is basically no latency between inputs - Pretty much on par
            with the tracking responsiveness of a Macbook trackpad. The texture
            is also smooth and pleasant to use. Multi-finger gestures work well.
            However, the trackpad tends to be mushy when you press down on the
            bottom corners or the bottom third of the trackpad. This is still an
            area which Macbooks excel in, probably due to the Macbook chassis
            not being tapered towards the bottom of the laptop. Overall, the
            trackpad is very much useable, just don't expect to be playing video
            games with it. (I used to play video games with my Macbook trackpad
            for a long time).
          </p>
          <h2 class="blogwrapper">Display</h2>
          <p>
            The display is 2880x1800@120Hz 400 nits, low-power, low-blue light,
            with 60Hz as an option as well. It's... fine. The 120Hz is always
            nice to have, though for its price the display meets expectations
            without surpassing any of them. Not much to say.
          </p>
          <h2 class="blogwrapper">Chassis</h2>
          <p>
            The chassis is made of plastic, but don't let that fool you. Like
            most other Thinkpads, it is sturdy and surprisingly light.
            Unfortunately, it does collect fingerprints pretty well, and you can
            definitely see fingerprints/handprints from the palm rests on either
            side of the trackpad.
          </p>
          <h2 class="blogwrapper">Battery</h2>
          <p>
            The battery isn't great, lasts around 3-5 hours for me depending on
            if I limit my GPU clock speeds and use a <code>powersave</code> CPU
            frequency governor. This doesn't really affect me as I keep my
            laptop plugged in, but I definitely would not this laptop if battery
            life is a main concern.
          </p>

            My Software Setup and Development Environment
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>OS - Arch Linux</li>
            <li>Browser - LibreWolf</li>
            <li>Terminal Emulator - GNOME terminal</li>
            <li>IDE/Text Editor - (N)Vim, VSCodium</li>
            <li>Word Processing - LibreOffice, OnlyOffice</li>
            <li>Notes - Obsidian, Logseq</li>
            <li>
              Package Managers - <code>pacman</code>, <code>yay</code>,
              <code>nixpkgs</code>,
              <code>flatpak</code>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I use <code>pacman</code> for anything that requires direct
                access with preinstalled dependencies (such as needing to
                interact with hardware information or kernel headers). I use
                <code>flaptak</code> for all GUI-based, non-programming apps. My
                IDE is installed from the AUR using <code>yay</code> because
                that depends on dependencies in the system (like
                <code>python3</code>) that I don't want to reinstall from
                flatpak. Finally, I use <code>nixpkgs</code> and tools such as
                <code>nix-shell</code> for containerization and to avoid
                dependency hell at all costs.
